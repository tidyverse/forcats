## Overview

R uses **factors** to handle categorical variables, variables that have
a fixed and known set of possible values. Factors are also helpful for
reordering character vectors to improve display. The goal of the
**forcats** package is to provide a suite of tools that solve common
problems with factors, including changing the order of levels or the
values. Some examples include:

- `fct_reorder()`: Reordering a factor by another variable.
- `fct_infreq()`: Reordering a factor by the frequency of values.
- `fct_relevel()`: Changing the order of a factor by hand.
- `fct_lump()`: Collapsing the least/most frequent values of a factor
  into “other”.

You can learn more about each of these in `vignette("forcats")`. If
you’re new to factors, the best place to start is the [chapter on
factors](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors.html) in R for Data Science.

## Installation

    # The easiest way to get forcats is to install the whole tidyverse:
    install.packages("tidyverse")

    # Alternatively, install just forcats:
    install.packages("forcats")

    # Or the the development version from GitHub:
    # install.packages("pak")
    pak::pak("tidyverse/forcats")

## Getting started

forcats is part of the core tidyverse, so you can load it with
`library(tidyverse)` or `library(forcats)`.

``` r
library(forcats)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
starwars %>% 
  filter(!is.na(species)) %>%
  count(species, sort = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 37 × 2
#>    species      n
#>    <chr>    <int>
#>  1 Human       35
#>  2 Droid        6
#>  3 Gungan       3
#>  4 Kaminoan     2
#>  5 Mirialan     2
#>  6 Twi'lek      2
#>  7 Wookiee      2
#>  8 Zabrak       2
#>  9 Aleena       1
#> 10 Besalisk     1
#> # ℹ 27 more rows
```

``` r
starwars %>%
  filter(!is.na(species)) %>%
  mutate(species = fct_lump(species, n = 3)) %>%
  count(species)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 2
#>   species     n
#>   <fct>   <int>
#> 1 Droid       6
#> 2 Gungan      3
#> 3 Human      35
#> 4 Other      39
```

``` r
ggplot(starwars, aes(x = eye_color)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
```
