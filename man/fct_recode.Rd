\usage{
fct_recode(.f, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.f}{A factor (or character vector).}

\item{...}{<\code{\link[rlang:dyn-dots]{dynamic-dots}}> A sequence of named character
vectors where the name gives the new level, and the value gives the old
level. Levels not otherwise mentioned will be left as is. Levels can
be removed by naming them \code{NULL}.}

Change factor levels by hand
}
\examples{
x <- factor(c("apple", "bear", "banana", "dear"))
fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana")

# If you make a mistake you'll get a warning
fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "bananana")

# If you name the level NULL it will be removed and its values become NA
fct_recode(x, NULL = "apple", fruit = "banana")

# Wrap the left hand side in quotes if it contains special variables
fct_recode(x, "an apple" = "apple", "a bear" = "bear")

# When passing a named vector to rename levels use !!! to splice
x <- factor(c("apple", "bear", "banana", "dear"))
levels <- c(fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana")
fct_recode(x, !!!levels)
}
\seealso{
\code{\link[=fct_explicit_na]{fct_explicit_na()}} to recode \code{NA} values to a level.
